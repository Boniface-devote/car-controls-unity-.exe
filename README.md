# Car Controls (Unity)

This repository contains a Unity project featuring a car with basic driving mechanics, packaged as a Windows executable (`.exe`) file. You can use this to simulate car movement, driving physics, and camera control within a 3D environment.

The project is designed to allow users to experience car controls in a game or simulation, and the included `.exe` file can be easily run without needing to set up Unity on your machine.

## Features

- **Car Movement:** Realistic car physics for forward, reverse, and steering control.
- **Camera System:** Follow camera that adapts to the carâ€™s movement and rotation.
- **Basic Interactions:** Simple controls for driving the car with basic acceleration, braking, and turning.


## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows (for `.exe` file).
- **Unity Version:** This project was developed using Unity 2023.x (adjust as needed).
- **.NET Framework:** The `.exe` file requires the .NET framework to be installed on your system.

## Installation

### 1. Download the .exe File

You can download the compiled `.exe` file from the Releases section of this repository.

- Download the `.exe` file for your system.

### 2. Run the .exe File

Once downloaded, simply double-click on the `.exe` file to launch the application. You can start driving the car and testing the controls right away.
